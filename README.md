The Code Quiz project is a JavaScript focused project requiring the use of arrays, functions, loops, and methods to generate a dynamic application that updates the viewport after each question is answered (whether correct or incorrect). Once the quiz begins, a timer is started and the user must select the correct answer otherwise 10 seconds are deducted from the time remaining. The user can submit a highscore that is saved to local storage upon successful completion of the quiz.  If the user runs out of time, the game ends and the user must restart from the beginning.
